# Excel Dashboard Project

## Background
Welcome to our Excel dashboard project! In this project, we've leveraged Excel's powerful features, including Power Query and PivotTables, to create a comprehensive dashboard aimed at extracting valuable insights from data provided by Maven Analytics. Our goal was to answer key questions related to the performance and operations of a coffee shop.

## Skills Utilized
- **Power Query**: We utilized Power Query to extract, transform, and load data efficiently.
- **PivotTables**: PivotTables were instrumental in organizing and summarizing the data to derive meaningful visualizations.
- **Data Analysis**: Through various Excel functions and tools, we conducted thorough data analysis to uncover insights.
- **Dashboard Development**: We designed and developed an interactive dashboard to present our findings in a user-friendly manner.

## What Did We Find?
Our dashboard provides answers to the following key questions:
1. **Peak Hours**: Determined the busiest working hours for the coffee shop.
2. **Average Order Size**: Calculated the average order per person to gauge customer behavior.
3. **Top Selling Item**: Identified the highest-selling item to focus on popular products.
4. **Busiest Days**: Analyzed which days of the week experience the highest volume of orders.
5. **Sales Breakdown**: Presented a breakdown of sales by month to identify trends and patterns.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we've streamlined the data analysis process and gained actionable insights to drive business decisions for the coffee shop. Special thanks to Maven Analytics for providing the comprehensive dataset that fueled this dashboard project, and a shoutout to WsCube Tech from YouTube for their invaluable guidance throughout the development process. We're excited about the potential impact of these insights on optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
